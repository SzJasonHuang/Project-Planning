    "The `players.csv` file contains a list of **196 unique users** and **7 features** describing each user.  \n",
    "Those features include:\n",
    " \n",
    "- `name` *(chr)* - Player's name.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `Age` *(int)* - The player’s age in years, ranging from **9 to 58 years old**, with **median** age around 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gender` *(chr)* - The player’s gender, contains multiple categories to represent diverse gender identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `experience` *(chr)* - Indicates a player's experience level. Possible levels include:  \n",
    "  `Beginner`, `Amateur`, `Regular`, `Pro`, and `Veteran`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `played_hours` *(dbl)* - Total hours the player has played. **Hours range from** 0 to 223.1, with a **mean** of 5.85 and a **median** of 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `subscribe` *(int)* - Indicates whether the player subscribed to a game-related newsletter (`TRUE` or `FALSE`). Out of 196 players, **144 (≈73.5%) subscribed**, and **52 (≈26.5%) did not**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `hashedEmail` *(chr)* - Player’s email stored as a hashed value for privacy. "

    "The broad question posed is: \"We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\" **To answer this broad question**, the specific question formulated is: Do `gender`, `experience`, and `subscribe` significantly predict whether a player is among the top 20% of players in terms of total hours spent playing the game (`played_hours`) in `players.csv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since our response variable indicates whether a player is among the **top 20%** of players by total hours played, we first compute the **80th percentile** of `played_hours`, then use `mutate()` on the `players` dataset to create a new binary variable `top_hours` which is our response variable for a potential KNN regression. \n",
